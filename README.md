# Team Name: The Meal Preppers

### Project Description:

Project Name: GigaBites
 
This software would be something like a meal planning tool, where users could post custom recipes for others to use, discuss, and modify. Recipes could consist of a user completed form containing a description of the end product, ingredients, and preparation methods, and would have user ratings, discussion, and any offshoot meal based on that meal attached. Users could then find recipes they’d like to make by following certain creators, searching by ingredients, or filtering by how difficult it would be to prepare. The overall idea would be a place to share favorite recipes and methods, find new ones, or create something new based on someone else’s ideas.

Meeting Time: Saturday 1300 (1pm)
